Community Disaster Risk Response System

The Community Disaster Risk Response System is a web-based platform designed to help communities stay safe and prepared during disasters. It allows people to quickly share reports, receive real-time alerts, and access important information such as evacuation routes, emergency hotlines, and available resources. The system also helps responders and local officials coordinate better by tracking incidents, supplies, and communication in one place. Its main goal is to make disaster response faster, clearer, and more organizedâ€”so that everyone in the community knows what to do and where to go when emergencies happen.
